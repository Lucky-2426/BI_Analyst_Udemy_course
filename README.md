# BI_analyst_course_udemy

This repository contains my codes for each topics of the BI Analyst Course taken on Udemy.

This course is about topics below :
- Statistics 
- SQL
- Python
- Tableau Desktop

Added value of the course : I had already intermediate level in Statistics, Tableau, SQL and Python. The course allowed me to upskill in SQL to advanced level, and mainly to practise more Python on a concrete project. I also take the advantage to review statistics concepts.

Negative points : If you want to learn Tableau, this is not the course to take cause it focuses more on SQL and Python for data analysis.
